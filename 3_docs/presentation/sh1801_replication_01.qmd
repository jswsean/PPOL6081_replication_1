# Introduction

## Motivation

:::{.incremental}

* How to measure power?
  - Difficult to empirically observe power
* Ban et al. (2019) provides an empirical measure of power via newspaper coverage
* Main thesis: relative amount of space dedicated to a particular subject 
measures the *relative* power of that subject. Why?
* Newsworthiness!
  - Size/impact of story matters
  - Prominence of actors also matters

:::

# Methods

## What kind of power?

:::{.incremental}
* This paper specifically measures whether, and to what extent, political actors
and offices possess the resources to influence political process.
  + Provides *cardinal* measure of power
  + Caveat 1: Newsworthiness does not necessarily translate to power, e.g. entertainment
  + Caveat 2: Potential bias from news outlets' ideological preferences
  + <span style="color:red;">Caveat 3: Does not measure the power of "shadowy" actors</span>
:::


## Data {.smaller}

* Primarily sourced from [Newspapers.com](https://www.newspapers.com/)
* Stratified sample from 50% of archive
* Focuses on years 1877-1977
* Uses OCR tools and `regex` to count occurrences of political actors and offices in newspapers texts

# (Validation) Results

## Validation 1: Valuing congressional committees

* Hypothesis: More powerful congressional committees should get more news coverage.
* Ban et al. (2019) validates this hypothesis with committee "value" rankings constructed by Groseclose and Stewart (1998)

$$
\text{Relative Coverage of Committee}_i = \frac{\text{Committee}_i}{\sum^{19}_{i=1} \text{Committee}_i}
$$

## Validation 2: Newspaper coverage of House Speakers

Hypothesis: There should be spike in coverage in the periods where 
senators serve as party leaders


## Result 2: Coverage of speakers before, during and after leadership

## Validation 3: Strong vs. weak mayors {.smaller}

* *Strong* mayors (mayor-council): 
  + Mayor and city council are elected separately
  + Mayor has broad executive authority
  
* *Weak* mayors (council-manager):
  + City council is the only elected office
  + Council appoints city manager to oversee executive branch
  + Mayor has little to no executive authority
  
* Hypothesis: Weaker mayor authority upon transition to council-manager setting,
thus lower mentions in newspapers.

$$
\hat{Y}_{ijt} = \frac{N_{ijt}}{\sum^{J}_{j=1} N_{ijt}}
$$

where $j \in \{\text{Mayor}, \text{City Manager}, \text{City Council}\}$, $N$, and $\hat{Y}$ denote mentions and relative proportions, respectively.

## Validation 4: Coverage of Massachussets Executive Council {.smaller}

* Massachussets Executive Council is comprised of eight individuals elected from districts
* In late 1964, the council was stripped of its statutory powers following corruption and bribery charges
* Hypothesis: lower newspapers coverage on the Executive Council following the reform 

$$
\text{EC}_t = \frac{\text{EC}_t}{\text{EC}_t + \text{G}_t}
$$

where $\text{EC}$ and $\text{G}$ denote mentions of the Executive Council and the Governor in all available Massachussets newspapers, respectively.

## Application: Measuring the power of state party committees

* Prediction: State committees are no longer as powerful as they once were
* Ban et al. (2019) uses newspaper coverage to measure the power of state committees relative to local committees

$$
\text{Relative Party Mentions}_{it} = \frac{\text{Party}_{it}}{\text{Party}_{it} + \text{Candidates}_{it}}
$$

# A Closer Look at the Replication Exercise

## Differences from the original results

:::{.incremental}
* Able to replicate all of the main findings 
* Minor differences in standard errors reported in regression table 3B
:::

## Replication diagnosis {.smaller}

* The authors could not provide access to the raw newspapers data since they are 
proprietary data.
* They only provide cleaned, aggregated term counts across years, states, etc.
* As such, I wasn't able to replicate the crucial first half of the paper, i.e., pre-processing the text.

![](screenshot_data_interface.png){width=70%}

## Replication diagnosis {.smaller}

* The authors used Stata to pre-process the term counts to generate measures of interest and R to visualize the output
* I convert all Stata codes to R, posted all codes and output images/tables on [GitHub](https://github.com/jswsean/PPOL6081_replication_1).
* I find one minor error in their code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

... %>%
  mutate(
    # Generate relative proportions
    rel_mayor_council_total = r_city_council + r_mayor,
    rel_mayor_council_control_total = r_control_sum_city_council + r_control_sum_mayor,
    rel_mayor_council = r_mayor / rel_mayor_council_total,
    rel_mayor_council_control = r_control_sum_mayor / rel_mayor_council_control_total, 
    
    # In the original paper, r_mayor was used instead of r_mayor_x
    rel_mayor_council_total_x = r_city_council_x + r_mayor_x, 
    rel_mayor_council_x = r_mayor_x / rel_mayor_council_total_x
  ) %>%
...

```



## Possible extensions

:::{.incremental}
* Possible extensions:

  - Application to the Indonesian case: rapid decentralization in 1998 shifts political power from central government to local government
  - Possible extension to other mediums, e.g., news broadcast?
  - Robustness checks to the DiD regression under new approaches by Callaway & Sant'Anna (2020), Chaisemartin & D'Haultf≈ìuille (2020)

* Limitations for extension:
  - Limited nuance of the power being measured
  - Limited use in developing country context due to pervasive power of "shadowy" political actors
  - Limited use of newspapers in modern context, and possible changes to the incentive structure of newspaper outlets
